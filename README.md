## Chleon Player 2019 (Unofficial - spotify)
<p>This is the unofficial update for the Chleon Player for Rainmeter. Chleon Player was originally made by marcopixel and the latest update was released in 2017. Due to new changes to spotify, the skin no longer work with the current version of Spotify, that is why I took the time to update the plugins with a up-to-date plugin named WebNowPlaying, released by tjhrulz.</p>

# How to install:
**The latest version of Rainmeter is required for this skin to work**
### Simple installation:
- Run the .rmskin-file and install the skin.

### Advanced installation:
- Click the green button at the top of this page that says "Clone or Download" and select "Download ZIP". Github will now ZIP the original ZIP-files I uploaded, we will be using the ZIP-file "Skins.ZIP" and "Plugins.ZIP" inside of the file you downloaded.
- Locate this folder in your Documents: *C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Rainmeter* , in this location you should have a folder called "Skins".
- Open the ZIP-file "Skins.ZIP" inside the file you downloaded and drag&drop/extract the folder named "Skins" from "Skins.ZIP" to the location you found. Click yes when prompted to merge/replace the already existing folder with the folder you extracted. **Your structure should look like this: *\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\Chleon-Player***
- Locate this folder *C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\Rainmeter* (simply write %appdata% in the URL of the windows-explorer)
- Open the ZIP-file "Plugins.ZIP" inside the file you downloaded and drag&drop/extract the folder called "Plugins" from the "Plugins.ZIP" to the location you found. Click yes when prompted to merge/replace the already existing folder with the folder you extracted.**Your structure should look like this: \AppData\Roaming\Rainmeter\Plugins***
- Open Rainmeter and load the skin "spotify.ini".
- **Give the skin a few seconds to prepare**, you can start spotify **before** or **after** loading the skin, the skin will look for any source providing information such as Artist-name, Title, Song duration, etc. (This is documented over at Tjhrulz' Github where he released the plugin WebNowPlaying that does the magic with the new Spotify version).
- *This skin does not monitor your computer, it only reads the Spotify.exe processor. I did not write the codes for this skin but I have looked through them (for my own safety). If you have any need for inquiry, please contact the original creator of this skin. I have only modified the .ini-file that controls what plugin to use and I have modified the existing syntax to match the new plugin.*

## Chleon Media Player

A minimalistic media player which fits on your deskop every time! Changes the color automatically to the desktop background.
Supports all major media players (AIMP, iTunes, Winamp, VLC, etc...) and full Spotify support (thanks to .raptor for the Spotify plugin).

#### Minimum Requirements:
 - Windows Vista
 - Rainmeter 3.3 (4.0 Beta recommended)

#### Features

- Live visualization of the audio output
- Automatic color change based on the background or album cover
- Support for all mayor media players
- Full Spotify support
- Media controls

#### Important notes


- You need at least Rainmeter 3.3 or higher to get all features of this skin. You can find the newest version on rainmeter.net
- After installation you can access the settings by right-clicking the skin and then clicking on Open Settings.
- Due to limitations of Rainmeter/the plugin used for the visualization the complete audio output of your system will be shown on the visualizer. For the best experience only play music. This is something I canâ€™t fix.
