# Chleon Player 2019 (Unofficial - spotify)
This is the unofficial update for the Chleon Player for Rainmeter. Chleon Player was originally made by marcopixel and the latest update was released in 2017. Due to new changes to spotify, the skin no longer work with the current version of Spotify, that is why I took the time to update the plugins with a up-to-date plugin named WebNowPlaying, released by tjhrulz.
I do not own any of the sources used, I only compiled them and fixed bugs.

# Chleon Media Player

A minimalistic media player which fits on your deskop every time! Changes the color automatically to the desktop background.
Supports all major media players (AIMP, iTunes, Winamp, VLC, etc...) and full Spotify support (thanks to .raptor for the Spotify plugin).

#### Minimum Requirements:
 - Windows Vista
 - Rainmeter 3.3 (4.0 Beta recommended)

#### Features

- Live visualization of the audio output
- Automatic color change based on the background or album cover
- Support for all mayor media players
- Full Spotify support
- Media controls

#### Important notes


- You need at least Rainmeter 3.3 or higher to get all features of this skin. You can find the newest version on rainmeter.net
- After installation you can access the settings by right-clicking the skin and then clicking on Open Settings.
- Due to limitations of Rainmeter/the plugin used for the visualization the complete audio output of your system will be shown on the visualizer. For the best experience only play music. This is something I canâ€™t fix.
